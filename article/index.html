<d-article>
  <p>
    Memorization in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) continues to pose a challenge
    in many applications. It is common to see that RNNs can only memorize a few
    "time" iterations back. Although, the desired behavior is for them to store
    relevant data for an indefinite amount of time and then retrieve it again
    when it becomes relevant.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) unit and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) are
    typically used to solve this memorization problem, by
    solving the vanishing gradient problem. However, the practical problem
    of memorization still poses a challenge. As such, developing new recurrent
    units that are better at memorization continues to an active field of
    research.
  </p>
  <p>
    To compare a recurrent unit with other alternatives, both past and recent
    papers, such as the Nested LSTM paper by Monzi et al.
    <d-cite key="moniz2018nlstm"></d-cite>, heavily rely on quantitative
    comparisons. These comparisons often measure the accuracy or
    cross entropy loss on standard problems such as Penn Treebank, Chinese
    Poetry Generation, or text8 generation where the task is to predict the
    next character given existing input.
  </p>
  <p>
    While quantitative comparisons are useful, they only provide partial
    insight into the how a recurrent unit memories. A model can, for example,
    achieve high accuracy and cross entropy loss by just providing highly accurate
    predictions in cases that only require short-term memorization, while
    being very inaccurate regarding predictions that require long-term
    memorization. For autocompleting words in a sentence, which will be studied
    here, a model may prioritize high accuracy when most of the characters
    in a word are known, but not have any long-term contextual understanding
    that allows it to predict a word when only the first few characters are
    known.
  </p>
  <p>
    This article presents a qualitative visualization method for comparing
    recurrent units, regarding memorization and contextual understanding.
    This method is then applied to some well known and recently proposed
    recurrent units, which are briefly covered in the first section.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is the hope that this visualization method, will help advance the
    dialogue when comparing recurrent units.
  </p>

  <h2>Recurrent Units</h2>
  <p>
    The networks that will be analyzed, all use a simple RNN structure:

    </div>
  </figure>
  <p>
    In theory, the time dependency allows it in each iteration to know
    about every part of the sequence that came before. However, this time
    dependency typically causes a vanishing gradient problem that results in
    long-term dependencies being ignored during training
    <d-cite key="pascanu2013vanishing"></d-cite>.
  </p>

      earlier steps becomes insignificant in the gradient for the vanilla RNN

  </figure>
  <p>
    Several solutions to the vanishing gradient problem have been proposed over
    the years. Most popular is the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
    <d-cite key="graves2008phd"></d-cite> unit and the
    Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)<d-cite key="cho2014gru"></d-cite>.
    Recently, the Nested LSTM unit has also been proposed
    <d-cite key="moniz2018nlstm"></d-cite>. Both LSTM and GRU are well known
    and <a href="http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/">
    thoroughly explained in the literature</a>. An explanation on Nested LSTM
    can be found <a href="#appendix-nestedlstm">in the appendix</a>.

  <p>
    It is not entirely clear why one recurrent unit is better than another
    in some applications, while in other applications it is another type of
    recurrent unit that is better. Theoretically, they all solve the vanishing
    gradient problem, but in practice, their performance is highly application
    dependent.
  </p>
  <p>
    Understanding why these differences occur is likely an opaque and
    challenging problem. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate a
    visualization technique that can better highlight what these differences
    are. Hopefully, such an understanding can lead to a deeper understanding.
  </p>

  <h2>Comparing Recurrent Units</h2>
  <p>
    Comparing the different Recurrent Units is an important task, and it is
    often much more involved than just comparing the accuracy or cross entropy
    loss. For example, differences in these high-level quantitative measures
    can have many explanations and may only be because of some small improvement
    in predictions that only requires short-term contextual understanding. While
    in reality, it is often the long-term contextual understanding that is of
    interest to us.
  </p>
  <h3>A problem for qualitative analysis</h3>
  <p>
    Therefore, a good problem for qualitatively analyzing the contextual
    understanding, should have a human-interpretable output and depend both on
    long-term and short-term contextual understanding. The typical problems
    that are often used, such as Penn Treebank, Chinese Poetry Generation, or
    text8 generation do not have outputs that are easy to reason about. As they
    require an extensive understanding of either grammar, Chinese poetry, or
    only outputs a single letter.
  </p>
  <p id="ar-section-autocomplete">
    To this end, the autocomplete problem is used. Each character is mapped
    to a target that represents the entire word. To make it extra challenging,
    the space leading up to the word should also map to that word. The
    prediction for the space character is in particular useful for showing
    contextual understanding.
  </p>
  <p>
    This makes the autocomplete problem quite similar to the text8 generation
    problem, where the only difference is that instead of predicting the next letter
    the entire word is predicted. Doing this makes the output much more
    interpretable. Finally, because of its close relation to text8 generation,
    existing literature on text8 generation is relevant and comparable,
    in the sense that models that work well on text8 generation should work
    well on the autocomplete problem.

    with 600 units. There are three models, using GRU, LSTM, and Nested LSTM.
    See <a href="#appendix-autocomplete">the appendix</a> for more details.
  </p>
  <h3>Connectivity in the Autocomplete Problem</h3>
  <p>
    In the recently published Nested LSTM paper
    <d-cite key="moniz2018nlstm"></d-cite>, they qualitatively compared their
    Nested LSTM unit to other recurrent units, to show how it memorizes in
    comparison, by visualizing individual cell activations.
  </p>
  <p>
    This visualization was inspired by Karpathy et al.
    <d-cite key="karpathy2015rnnvis"></d-cite> where they identify cells
    that captures a specific feature. For identifying a specific
    feature, this visualization approach works well. However, it is not a useful
    argument for memorization in general as the output is entirely dependent
    on what feature the specific cell captures.
  </p>
  <p>
    Instead, to get a better idea of how well each model memorizes and uses
    memory for contextual understanding, the connectivity between the desired
    output and the input is analyzed. This is calculated as:
  </p>
  <figure class="ar-math-figure">

    Exploring the connectivity gives a surprising amount of insight into the
    different models' ability for long-term contextual understanding. You should
    try and interact with the figure below yourself, to see what information the
    different models use for their predictions.
  </p>

    <figcaption>
      <strong>Connectivity:</strong> shows the connection strength between
      the target for the selected character and the input characters
      (<a href="javascript:connectivitySetIndex(null);">reset</a>).
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    In case you missed it, here are three critial observations:
  </p>
  <figure>
    <div id="ar-walkthrough">
      <div class="ar-walkthrough-step">
        <div class="ar-walkthrough-number">1</div>
        <div class="ar-walkthrough-text">
          <p>
          The first observation is how the <a href="javascript:connectivitySetIndex(106);">
          models predict the word "learning" while only being given the first two
          characters</a>. Here it is clear, that the Nested LSTM
          model uses no past information and thus only suggests common words starting
          with the letter "l".
          </p>
          <p>
          The LSTM and GRU model both suggests the word "learning". However, as
          the GRU model has much stronger connectivity with the word
          "advanced", it sets the probability much higher.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="ar-walkthrough-step">
        <div class="ar-walkthrough-number">2</div>
        <div class="ar-walkthrough-text">
          <p>
          The second observation is how the models predict the word "grammar".
          This word appears twice, for the first case very little is known
          about the context. Thus, the models do not suggest "grammar" until they have
          <a href="javascript:connectivitySetIndex(32);">seen 4 characters</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
          For the second occurrence, there is much more text for the models to
          understand the context of the word. The GRU model is thus able to predict
          the word "grammar" with only <a href="javascript:connectivitySetIndex(159);">
          1 character from the word itself</a>. While the LSTM and Nested LSTM again
          needs <a href="javascript:connectivitySetIndex(162);">4 characters</a>.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="ar-walkthrough-step">
        <div class="ar-walkthrough-number">3</div>
        <div class="ar-walkthrough-text">
          <p>
            Finally, predicting the word "schools"
            <a href="javascript:connectivitySetIndex(159);">
            given only the first character</a>. Shows, like in the other cases
            that the GRU model is better at using past information for
            contextual understanding.
          </p>
          <p>
            What is unusual for this case is that the LSTM model, appears to
            use words from almost the entire sentence as context. However,
            its predictions are far from correct and have little to do
            with the previous words it uses. This suggests that the LSTM
            model in this setup is capable of long-term memorization, but not
            long-term contextual understanding.
          </p>

      </div>
      <div class="ar-walkthrough-pages">

      past information. <strong><em>Clicking on the links above will change what is
      viewed in connectivity figure.</em></strong>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    These observations show that the connectivity visualization is a powerful tool
    for comparing models in terms of what they use for contextual understanding.
    Although, it is only possible to compare given the same dataset, and only
    for one specific example. As such, while these observations may show that
    Nested LSTM is not very capable of long-term contextual understanding;
    these observations may not generalize to other datasets or hyperparameters.
  </p>
  <h3>Future works; quantitative metric</h3>
  <p>
    From the above observations, it appears that short-term contextual understanding
    often involves the word itself. That is the neural network switch to
    use previously seen letters from the word itself, as more letters become
    available. While at the beginning of predicting a word, especially the
    GRU network, uses previously seen words as context for the prediction.
  </p>
  <p>
    This observation leads to a quantitative metric, where one measures
    the accuracy, depending on how many letters from the word
    is already known. However, it is not clear that this is best quantitative
    metric, for one it is highly problem dependent, and it also doesn't
    summarize the model to a single number, which one may wish for a more
    direct comparison.
   </p>
   <figure>
     <div id="ar-accuracy-graph"></div>
     <figcaption>
       <strong>Accuracy Graph</strong>: shows the accuracy
       given a fixed number of characters in a word that the RNN has seen.
       0 characters mean that the RNN has only seen the space leading up
       to the word, including all the previous text which should provide context.
       The different line styles, indicates if the correct word should appear
       among the top 1, 2, or 3 suggestions.
      </figcaption>
   </figure>
   <p>
     These results suggest that the GRU model is better at long-term contextual
     understanding, while the LSTM model is better at short-term contextual
     understanding. These observations are valuable, as it justifies why the
     <a href="#ar-overall-accuracy">overall accuracy of the GRU and LSTM models
     </a> are almost identical, while the connectivity visualization shows that
     the GRU model is far better at long-term contextual understanding.
   </p>
   <p>
     While more detailed qualitative metrics like this provides new insight,
     qualitative analysis like the connectivity figure presented
     in this article still has great value. As the connectivity visualization gives an
     intuitive understanding of how the model works, which a quantitative metric
     cannot. It also shows that a wrong prediction can still be considered a
     useful prediction, such as a synonym or a contextually reasonable
     prediction.
   </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Looking at overall accuracy and cross entropy loss in itself is not that
    interesting. Different models may prioritize either long-term or
    short-term contextual understanding, while both models can have similar
    accuracy and cross entropy.
  </p>
  <p>
    A qualitative analysis, where one looks at how previous input is used in
    the prediction is therefore also important when judging models. In this
    case, the connectivity visualization together with the autocomplete
    predictions, reveals that the GRU model is much more capable of long-term
    contextual understanding, compared to LSTM and Nested LSTM. In the case of
    LSTM, the difference is much higher than one would guess from just looking
    at the overall accuracy and cross entropy loss alone. This observation is
    not that interesting in itself as it is likely very dependent on the
    hyperparameters, and the specific application.
  </p>
  <p>
    Much more valuable is that this visualization method makes it possible
    to intuitively understand how the models are different, to a much higher
    degree than just looking at accuracy and cross entropy. For this application,
    it is clear that the GRU model uses repeating words and semantic meaning
    of past words to make its prediction, to a much higher degree than the LSTM
    and Nested LSTM models. This is both a valuable insight when choosing the
    final model, but also essential knowledge when developing better models
    in the future.

  <h3 id="appendix-nestedlstm">Nested LSTM</h3>
  <p>
    The Nested LSTM unit attempt to solve the long-term memorization from a
    more practical point of view. Where the standard LSTM unit solves the
    vanishing gradient problem by adding internal memory, and the GRU attempt
    to be a faster solution than LSTM by using no internal memory, the Nested
    LSTM goes in the opposite direction of GRU by adding additional memory to
    the unit <d-cite key="moniz2018nlstm"></d-cite>.
    The idea here is that adding additional memory to the unit allows for more
    long-term memorization.

    "></math-latex>, as done in vanilla LSTM, it uses another LSTM unit:
    <math-latex display-mode latex="
      c_\ell^t = \mathrm{LSTM}(i_\ell^t \odot z_\ell^t, f_\ell^t \odot c_\ell^{t-1})
    "></math-latex>

    in the appendix</a>. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    The complete set of equations then becomes:
    <math-latex display-mode latex="\begin{aligned}
      i_\ell^t &= \sigma_i(IW_{\ell-1, \ell} h_{\ell-1}^{t} + IW_{\ell, \ell} h_{\ell}^{t-1}) \\
      f_\ell^t &= \sigma_f(FW_{\ell-1, \ell} h_{\ell-1}^{t} + FW_{\ell, \ell} h_{\ell}^{t-1}) \\
      o_\ell^t &= \sigma_o(OW_{\ell-1, \ell} h_{\ell-1}^{t} + OW_{\ell, \ell} h_{\ell}^{t-1}) \\
      z_\ell^t &= \sigma_z(ZW_{\ell-1, \ell} h_{\ell-1}^{t} + ZW_{\ell, \ell} h_{\ell}^{t-1}) \\
      c_\ell^t &= \mathrm{LSTM}(i_\ell^t \odot z_\ell^t, f_\ell^t \odot c_\ell^{t-1}) \\
      h_{\ell}^{t} &= \mathrm{NLSTM}(h_{\ell-1}^{t}, h_{\ell}^{t-1}) \coloneqq o_\ell^t \odot \sigma_h(c_{\ell}^{t})
    \end{aligned}"></math-latex>
  </p>
  <p>
    Like in vanilla LSTM, the gate activation functions <math-latex latex="
    \left(\sigma_i(\cdot), \sigma_f(\cdot), \text{ and } \sigma_o(\cdot)\right)
    "></math-latex> are usually the simoid activation function. However,
    only the <math-latex latex="\sigma_h(\cdot)"></math-latex> is set to
    <math-latex latex="\tanh(\cdot)"></math-latex>. While,
    <math-latex latex="\sigma_z(\cdot)"></math-latex> is just the identity
    function, otherwise two non-linear activation functions would be applied
    on the same scalar without any change, except for the multiplication by
    the input gate. The activation functions for  <math-latex latex="
    \mathrm{LSTM}(\cdot, \cdot)"></math-latex> remains the same.
  </p>
  <p>
    The abstraction, of how to combine the input with the cell value, allows
    for a lot of flexibility. Using this abstraction, it is not only possible
    to add one extra internal memory state but the internal
    <math-latex latex="\mathrm{LSTM}(\cdot, \cdot)"></math-latex> unit can
    recursively be replaced by as many internal
    <math-latex latex="\mathrm{NLSTM}(\cdot, \cdot)"></math-latex> units as
    one would wish, thereby adding even more internal memory.

  The equations defining <math-latex latex="
  \mathrm{LSTM}(\cdot, \cdot)"></math-latex> as used in <math-latex latex="
  \mathrm{NLSTM}(\cdot, \cdot)"></math-latex> are:
  <math-latex display-mode latex="\begin{aligned}
    \tilde{i}_\ell^t &= \sigma_i(IW_{\ell-1, \ell} \tilde{h}_{\ell-1}^{t} + IW_{\ell, \ell} \tilde{h}_{\ell}^{t-1}) \\
    \tilde{f}_\ell^t &= \sigma_f(FW_{\ell-1, \ell} \tilde{h}_{\ell-1}^{t} + FW_{\ell, \ell} \tilde{h}_{\ell}^{t-1}) \\
    \tilde{o}_\ell^t &= \sigma_o(OW_{\ell-1, \ell} \tilde{h}_{\ell-1}^{t} + OW_{\ell, \ell} \tilde{h}_{\ell}^{t-1}) \\
    \tilde{z}_\ell^t &= \sigma_z(ZW_{\ell-1, \ell} \tilde{h}_{\ell-1}^{t} + ZW_{\ell, \ell} \tilde{h}_{\ell}^{t-1}) \\
    \tilde{c}_\ell^t &= \tilde{i}_\ell^t \odot \tilde{z}_\ell^t + \tilde{f}_\ell^t \odot \tilde{c}_\ell^{t-1} \\
    \tilde{h}_{\ell}^{t} &= \mathrm{LSTM}(\tilde{h}_{\ell-1}^{t}, \tilde{h}_{\ell}^{t-1}) \coloneqq \tilde{o}_\ell^t \odot \sigma_h(\tilde{c}_\ell^t)
  \end{aligned}"></math-latex>
  In terms of the Nested LSTM unit, <math-latex latex="
  \tilde{h}_{\ell-1}^{t} = i_\ell^t \odot z_\ell^t"></math-latex> and
  <math-latex latex="\tilde{h}_{\ell}^{t-1} = f_\ell^t \odot c_\ell^{t-1}"></math-latex>.

    The gate activation functions <math-latex latex="
    \left(\sigma_i(\cdot), \sigma_f(\cdot), \text{ and } \sigma_o(\cdot)\right)
    "></math-latex> are usually the simoid activation function.
    While <math-latex latex="

  <h3 id="appendix-autocomplete">Autocomplete Problem</h3>
  <p>
    The autocomplete dataset is constructed from the full
    <a href="http://mattmahoney.net/dc/textdata.html">text8</a> dataset, where
    each observation consists of maximum 200 characters and is ensured not to
    contain partial words. 90% of the observations are used for training,
    5% for validation and 5% for testing.
  </p>
  <p>
    The input vocabulary is a-z, space, and a padding symbol. The output
    vocabulary consists of the <math-latex latex="2^{14} = 16384"></math-latex>
    most frequent words, and two additional symbols, one for padding and one
    for unknown words. The network is not penalized for predicting padding
    and unknown words wrong.
  </p>
  <p>
    The GRU, LSTM each have 2 layers of 600 units. Similarly, the Nested LSTM
    model has 1 layer of 600 units but with 2 internal memory states.
    Additionally, each model has an input embedding layer and a final dense
    layer to match the vocabulary size.

    There are 456896 sequences in the training dataset, and a mini-batch size
    of 64 observations is used. A single iteration over the entire dataset
    then corresponds to 7139 mini-batches. The training runs twice over the
    dataset, thus corresponding to trained for 14278 mini-batches. For training,
    Adam optimization is used with default parameters.
